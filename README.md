# MANEOK Shopify Theme

This repository contains a Shopify theme used for the MANEOK storefront. The theme's templates are written using Shopify's Liquid language. Liquid files rely on Shopify's environment for rendering and cannot be viewed as plain HTML in a browser.

## Preview the theme locally

1. Install the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli).
2. Authenticate with your store via `shopify login`.
3. Run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
shopify theme serve
```

The CLI uploads the theme to your store and provides a local URL to preview it.
